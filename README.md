# Vue - Planner
An event planner app. The app allows you to create/edit/delete events on different days. 

# Setup - client
```
yarn run dev
```
```
yarn build
```
If the graphql server is not on local machine, you should edit client/src/main.ts and change uri value.


# Setup - server
```
yarn start
```


# Demo

https://vue-planner.netlify.app/ - if the app doesn't load, wait a while for a server to start running.
